# Mechatronics_Capstone
## Overview
### This is a 4th year mechatronics engineering capstone project, The function of the device is to autonomously navigate a tomato or cherry tomato in greenhouse, and identify, pick, and collect tomatoes. This task was decomposed into several subsystems, navigation, image processing and robotic manipulation.
